            <Text>Solanum is the last Nomai alive. What if I'll show her all I know with vision torch from <![CDATA[<color=green>Damaged Laboratory</color>]]> on <![CDATA[<color=green>Stranger</color>]]>?</Text>

            <Text>After the vision something strange happened. Clouds disappeared immidiately and I can hear now unknown <![CDATA[<color=green>frequencies</color>]]> coming from Solanum. Also that sparks on her mask - that looks bizarre. Solanum looks disoriented according to her reply.</Text>

            <Text>It should be very strange to see your own body. I'm not surprised Solanum want to leave this place as soon as possible. She took her recorder and asking me to find her somehow. Maybe start search from Timber Hearth?</Text>
