  <TextBlock>
    <ID>1</ID>
    <Text>SOLANUM: It's you, friend. I feel like my mind is clear now, but I can't explain this, even for myself.</Text>
  </TextBlock>
  <TextBlock>
    <ID>2</ID>
    <ParentID>1</ParentID>
    <Text>SOLANUM: I'm here, right? But how I am here? I thought about <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Timber Hearth</color>]]> and now I am here.</Text>
  </TextBlock>
  <TextBlock>
    <ID>3</ID>
    <ParentID>2</ParentID>
    <Text>SOLANUM: So, Nomai are dead? All of them? It's really sad to know, but how much time has passed? Last thing I remember is that Bells guided me on the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>]]> pilgrimage like it was an hour ago. All these years I was trapped in quantum uncertainty.</Text>
  </TextBlock>
  <TextBlock>
    <ID>4</ID>
    <ParentID>3</ParentID>
    <Text>SOLANUM: I've never met one of your kind before. It's an honor to speak with you! I particularly admire your four eyes. And I... I have to apologize on behalf of the clan. We tried to explode the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>sun</color>]]> once and that would've turned your race to ashes. This is unacceptable ethically, but I'm happy we failed. It is impossible for me not to say this, when I observe this young, curious race growing up.</Text>

  <TextBlock>
    <ID>5</ID>
    <ParentID>4</ParentID>
    <Text>SOLANUM: I think it's time to find out what is happening here and why we are here. You saw that <![CDATA[<color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color>]]>? Is it.. broken? I need to check its <![CDATA[<color=orange>Probe Tracking Module</color>]]> first.</Text>
