    <Text>SOLANUM: Have you seen this? Our <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>sun</color>]]> is dying and you.. are you connected with the one of statue? Someone at <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Giantâ€™s Deep</color>]]> is also connected. I wonder who or what that could be?</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: Never mind, I forgot that you can't respond since I cannot understand your language. That means that you're trapped in the time loop right before the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>sun</color>]]> goes supernova. Lucky day, huh? Or not. Sorry.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: I just realized that we're running out of time. Most likely I'll be back on the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Quantum Moon</color>]]> after the loop resets according to your memories, right? That's how it works?</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: Can we actually escape? The supernova will be really huge, but what if we just fly away from it? It should work. The warp core is charged from the last loop's supernova so we can try using it to get out of here before the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>sun</color>]]> explodes again.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: I saw the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Vessel</color>]]> from your vision, it is inside <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Dark Bramble</color>]]>. What if it's still working? I'm not sure if I can get there, but I need to at least try.</Text>
