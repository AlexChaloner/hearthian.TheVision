    <Text>SOLANUM: Have you seen this? Our Sun is diying and you.. are you connected with the one of statue? Someone also connected from Giant's Deep, who or what is it?</Text>

    <ParentID>1</ParentID>
    <Text>SOLANUM: Oh, I forgot that you can't respond, I mean I can't understand your language so nevermind. That means that you're trapped in the time loop before the Sun explode. Lucky day, huh? Or not. Sorry.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: I just realized that we're running out of time. Most likely I'll get back on Quantum Moon after the reset according to your memories, right? That's how it works?</Text>
  </TextBlock>

    <ParentID>3</ParentID>
    <Text>SOLANUM: But can we actually escape? Explotion will be really huge, but what if we just fly away from it? It should work. Warp Core is charged from last loop exposion so we can try to get out of here before the it actually explode.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: I saw the Vessel from your vision, it's in the Dark Bramble. What if it's still working? Not sure if I can get there, but I need to try at least.</Text>
